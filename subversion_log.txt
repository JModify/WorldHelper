Commenting which outlines the purpose of the has_duplicates() added.
Dictionary file getter function added which by default retrieves the dictionary file from /usr/share/dict/words. If the associated environment variable is set, then the funtion will use the directory defined there.

Added function handle_alpha_argument() which is able to validate both the -with and -without arguments passed to the main function. 
Added function is_string_alpha() which determines if a string is alpha numeric. The function will also return false if the string parsed into it is empty.
Renamed get_length_arg() to handle_length_argument() to make it's purpose more clear.

Implemented is_sorting_alpha() function which determines whether or not the -alpha argument has been specified.
Implemented is_sorting_beta() function which determines whether or not the -beta argument has been specified.
Added validity check to the main function which ensures both -alpha and -beta have not both been specified in the command line.
Edited general_argument_validity_check() to check for duplication of -alpha or -beta arguments, if any duplication of these are found, the function will now fail.
More detailed commenting written for general_argument_validity_check() which also now specifies the change above which was made.

Implemented handle_pattern_argument() which takes the arguments from the main function and checks for and validates the pattern argument.
Implemented matches_pattern_format() method which is used in the pattern argument handler to determine if a string is in the format of a pattern, a pattern is defined as a string which consists
of only letters (uppercase and lowercase) and underscores and matches a defined length X.
Updated general_argument_validity_check() to now be able to tell if an argument is a pattern argument. This validator also now receives information about a validated pattern and it's index so it can determine if there were 2 pattern arguments entered.
Main function updated to include pattern argument and return correct exit code if the pattern argument fails to be validated.

Code cleanup for handle_pattern_argument.
Fixed a bug where the pattern argument would be checked for validity before the command line was checked.
Renamed general_argument_validity_check() to command_line_validity_check() to make it's purpose more clear.
Moved all argument duplication checks into command_line_validity_check() since this makes the most sense.
Cleaned up code in the main() function and added comments to explain each of the validity checks.

Implemented get_dictionary() function which attempts to use the environment variable "WORDLE_DICTIONARY" to find the directory of words. If the variable is set but the file cannot be opened, the function will exit the program with code 3. If the variable is not set, the function will use the default directory /usr/share/dict/words.

Implemented get_dictionary_file() function which will first check to see if the environment variable "WORDLE_DICTIONARY" is set, then attempt to open the directory specified as this variables
value. The function will use the directory /usr/share/dict/words if this environment variable is not set.
Implemented get_dictionary() function which copies all words in the dictionary file into a Dictionary structure - this consists of a copy of all the words, and the total number of words.
Initial work on the print_dictionary() function which will take all the variables specified in the command line and print the dictionary accordingly. As of right now, this function only considers and prints words of valid length.

Program now prints all words in uppercase and with valid length using the print_dictionary() function.
Implemented format_string() function which takes a string received through the wordle dictionary and formats it to upper case with exclusion of the \n character. Memory is free'ed after use.

Added word_without_characters() function which compares a word with an array of characters and returns false if the word contains any of these characters.
Added word_with_characters() function which compares a word with an array of characters and returns true only if the word contains all of these characters with respect to how many times these
characters should appear in the word. 
Updated print_dictionary() function to now print the dictionary using the functions above (with characters and/or without characters).

Removed get_dictionary() function as it's intended use is now coded into the print_dictionary() function.
print_dictionary() function is now able to sort words in alphabetical order (no duplication removal yet).
print_dictionary() function is not able to sort words in best order (no duplication removal yet).
Added print_words() function which a list of words, prints them to standard output then free's each one from memory - intended use for print_dictionary() only.
Fixed bug where the dictionary file was not closed after use - simple added fclose line once the dictionary has been printed.
Fixed bug where memory was not free'd for the word list to be sorted.

Updated commenting of print_dictionary() to include dictionary_file rather than Dictionary struct.
Implemented duplication removal for -best and -alpha algorithms - this was done by simply replacing duplicates with a placeholder which is later skipped over when printing words.
Fixed bug where -best was not sorting in alphabetical order when words were of equal likelihood.
Cleaned up commenting of program to no longer include parameter types (already specified in function parameters).
